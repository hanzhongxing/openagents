"""
Basic Test Mod gRPC communication test.

This test verifies that the basic test mod works correctly:
1. Network loads the basic test mod from basic_mod_test.yaml
2. gRPC clients can connect to the network
3. Clients can interact with the basic test mod functionality
4. Mod processes events and maintains state correctly
5. Agent adapters provide tools and handle events properly

No mocks - uses real gRPC clients and network infrastructure with the basic test mod.
