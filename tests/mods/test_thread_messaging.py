"""
Comprehensive integration tests for the Thread Messaging mod.

This test suite verifies the thread messaging mod functionality using real gRPC clients
and network infrastructure. Tests include:

1. Direct messaging between agents using agent.message event
2. Broadcast messaging using agent.message with agent:broadcast destination
3. Channel messaging and thread creation
4. File upload and download functionality
5. Message retrieval and pagination
6. Reaction system
7. Thread-based replies and nested conversations
8. Channel management and agent membership

Uses workspace_test.yaml configuration with thread messaging mod enabled.
