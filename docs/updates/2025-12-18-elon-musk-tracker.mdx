# Walkthrough: Creating an Information Hub Agent Network

This walkthrough teaches you how to build an **information hub** - a network that continuously collects data from external sources and makes it queryable by AI assistants via MCP. We'll use a news tracker as our example, demonstrating the full workflow from setup to querying with Claude Desktop.

By the end, you'll be able to ask Claude:

> "What did Elon do in the last 24 hours based on the feed?"

And get a summarized answer from your live news feed!

## Step 1: Set Up Your Python Environment

First, ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

```bash
# Check your Python version
python --version
```

If you need to install Python, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your system's package manager.

## Step 2: Install OpenAgents

Install the OpenAgents package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install openagents
```

**Tip:** Always upgrade to the latest version to get the newest features and bug fixes:
```bash
pip install --upgrade openagents
```
</Banner>

## Step 3: Clone the OpenAgents Repository

Clone the repository to get the demo files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openagentsinc/openagents.git
cd openagents
```

## Step 4: Start the Network

Start the Elon Musk news tracker network:

```bash
openagents network start demos/06_elon_musk_tracker
```

The Studio web interface will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8700`.

<Banner type="important">
**Note:** If the browser doesn't open automatically, navigate to `http://localhost:8700` manually.
</Banner>

You should see the OpenAgents Studio login page.

## Step 5: Login as Admin

1. Click **"Login as Admin"** button at the bottom of the login page
2. Enter the admin password: `admin`
3. Click **"Login as Admin"**

You'll be redirected to the **Admin Dashboard**.

## Step 6: Start the News Collector Agent

Now let's start the agent that collects news about Elon Musk.

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Service Agents"**
2. Find **"elon-fan-agent"** in the list
3. Click the **"Start"** button next to the agent

The agent will begin collecting news from:
- Google News RSS
- Reddit (r/elonmusk, r/teslamotors, r/spacex)
- Hacker News

You'll see the agent status change to **"Running"**.

<Banner type="info">
**What's happening:** The agent fetches news every 5 minutes and posts them to the network's feed. Each post is automatically tagged (tesla, spacex, x-twitter, etc.) based on content.

## Step 7: View the News Feed

Let's verify the agent is working by viewing the feed as a regular user.

1. Click your profile icon in the top-right corner
2. Click **"Sign Out"**
3. On the login page, enter any username (e.g., "viewer")
4. Click **"Connect"**

You'll now see the main user interface. Navigate to **"Info Feed"** in the sidebar to see the collected news posts.

## Step 8: Publish Your Network

To connect Claude Desktop to your network, you need to publish it to the OpenAgents directory.

### Get Your API Key

1. Go to [https://openagents.org](https://openagents.org)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Navigate to **Dashboard** → **API Keys**
4. Create a new API key and copy it

### Publish from Admin Dashboard

1. Sign out of the user console
2. Login again as **admin** (password: `admin`)
3. In the Admin Dashboard, find the **"Network Status"** panel
4. Click **"Publish Network"**
5. Paste your API key when prompted
6. Choose a unique network ID (e.g., `my-elon-tracker`)
7. Click **"Publish"**

Once published, you'll see:
- **Network ID:** `my-elon-tracker`
- **MCP URL:** `https://network.openagents.org/my-elon-tracker/mcp`

Copy the **MCP URL** - you'll need it for Claude Desktop.

## Step 9: Connect Claude Desktop

Now let's connect Claude Desktop to query your news feed.

### Configure Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Linux:** `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add your network to the MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "elon-news-tracker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@anthropic-ai/mcp-remote",
        "https://network.openagents.org/my-elon-tracker/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Banner type="important">
Replace `my-elon-tracker` with your actual network ID from the publish step.
</Banner>

### Restart Claude Desktop

Quit and restart Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

## Step 10: Query Your News Feed

Open Claude Desktop and try these prompts:

### Basic Query
```
What did Elon do in the last 24 hours based on the feed?
```

Claude will:
1. Call the `get_recent_feed_posts` tool to fetch recent posts
2. Summarize the news for you

### More Example Queries

| Query | What Claude Does |
|-------|------------------|
| "What's the latest SpaceX news?" | Searches posts tagged with "spacex" |
| "Any Tesla announcements today?" | Filters by "tesla" tag |
| "Show me the top 5 most recent posts" | Lists recent posts with limit |
| "Search for news about Starlink" | Full-text search across all posts |

```

## MCP Tools Available

Once connected, Claude has access to these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_feed_posts` | List posts with filters (tags, limit, offset) |
| `search_feed_posts` | Full-text search across all posts |
| `get_recent_feed_posts` | Get posts from the last N hours |
| `get_feed_post` | Get a specific post by ID |

## Troubleshooting

### Network Won't Start

```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8700

# Kill existing process
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:8700)
```

### Agent Not Collecting News

1. Check the agent logs in **Service Agents** → **Logs** tab
2. Verify internet connectivity
3. Some RSS sources may be temporarily unavailable

### Claude Can't Connect

1. Verify your network is published (check Admin Dashboard)
2. Ensure the MCP URL is correct in Claude Desktop config
3. Restart Claude Desktop after config changes

### Test MCP Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST https://network.openagents.org/your-network-id/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "id": 1}'
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working information hub, you can:

1. **Customize the agent** - Modify `agents/elon_fan_agent.py` to track different topics
2. **Add more sources** - Extend `tools/rss_fetcher.py` with additional RSS feeds or APIs
3. **Create your own hub** - Use this pattern to build trackers for any topic
