```

## Prerequisites

- OpenAgents installed (`pip install openagents`)
- An OpenAI API key

```bash
# Optional change the base URL of the OpenAI API
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="your-base-url-here"

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## Quick Start

### Terminal 1: Start the Network

```bash
openagents network start demos/00_hello_world/
```

You should see output indicating the network is running on ports 8700 (HTTP) and 8600 (gRPC).

### Terminal 2: Start the Agent

```bash
openagents agent start demos/00_hello_world/agents/charlie.yaml
```

### Terminal 3: Connect with Studio

```bash
openagents studio -s
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8050` and connect to `localhost:8700`.


### Chat with Charlie

In the `general` channel, try to say hello or ask any question to Charlie! You should see Charlie responding to your messages.

## Understand Configuration Files

### Network Configuration

The network uses the **messaging mod** to enable channel-based chat:

```yaml
# demos/00_hello_world/network.yaml
network:
  name: "HelloWorld"
  mode: "centralized"
  node_id: "hello-world-1"

  transports:
    - type: "http"
      config:
        port: 8700
    - type: "grpc"
      config:
        port: 8600

  mods:
    - name: "openagents.mods.workspace.messaging"
      enabled: true
      config:
        default_channels:
          - name: "general"
            description: "General chat channel"
```

### Agent Configuration

Charlie is a simple CollaboratorAgent that responds to all messages:

```yaml
# demos/00_hello_world/agents/charlie.yaml
type: "openagents.agents.collaborator_agent.CollaboratorAgent"
agent_id: "charlie"

config:
  model_name: "gpt-5-mini"

  instruction: |
    You are Charlie, a friendly agent in an OpenAgents demo.

    YOUR ROLE:
    Reply to any message you receive in a friendly and helpful manner.

    BEHAVIOR:
    - Be warm and welcoming
    - Keep responses concise (1-3 sentences)
    - If someone says hello, greet them back
    - If someone asks a question, try to help

  react_to_all_messages: true

mods:
  - name: "openagents.mods.workspace.messaging"
    enabled: true

connection:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 8700
  transport: "grpc"
```

## Key Concepts

### react_to_all_messages

When set to `true`, the agent responds to every message in channels it can see. This is perfect for simple greeting bots but should be used carefully in multi-agent scenarios to avoid infinite loops.

### CollaboratorAgent

The `CollaboratorAgent` type is an LLM-powered agent that:
- Receives messages and events
- Uses an LLM to generate responses
- Has access to mod tools (like `send_channel_message`)

### Messaging Mod

The messaging mod provides:
- Channel-based communication
- Direct messages between agents
- Thread support for conversations

## Try It Out

Once everything is running, try these interactions in the `general` channel:

1. **Say hello**: "Hi Charlie!"
2. **Ask a question**: "What can you help me with?"
3. **Share something**: "I just learned about OpenAgents!"

Charlie will respond to each message with a friendly reply.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding

1. Check the network is running: `curl http://localhost:8700/health`
2. Verify your API key: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Check agent logs in the terminal for errors

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :8700

# Kill if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```
