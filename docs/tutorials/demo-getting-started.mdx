# Getting Started with Demos

Before running any of the demo walkthroughs, you'll need to clone the OpenAgents repository to get the demo source code.

## Clone the Repository

Clone the OpenAgents repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openagents-org/openagents.git
cd openagents
```

## Locate the Demos

All demos are located in the `demos/` directory:

```bash
ls demos/
```

You should see the following demo folders:

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `00_hello_world` | Simplest demo - one agent replies to messages |
| `01_startup_pitch_room` | Multi-agent roleplay with founder, engineer, and investor |
| `02_tech_news_stream` | Hacker News integration with Python WorkerAgent |
| `03_research_team` | Router-based task delegation using project mod |
| `04_grammar_check_forum` | Forum with automatic grammar checking |

## Install Dependencies

Here we assume you have already installed OpenAgents. If not, please run the following command to install it:

```bash
pip install openagents
```

## Set up API Keys for using LLMs

For all demos, you need to set up API keys for using LLMs. By default, all agents in the demos are configured to use OpenAI models (specifically, gpt-5-mini).

You can set up the API key for OpenAI by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

If you are using a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint, you can set the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable.

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-custom-endpoint.com"
```

If you are using Azure OpenAI, you can set the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

**Important:** You have to export the API keys in the same terminal whenever you start an agent.

You can also change the model providers, say, to Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini, but this requires you to modify the agent configuration files.

## Next Steps

Now you're ready to explore the demos:

1. **[Hello World](/tutorials/demo-hello-world)** - Start with the simplest demo
2. **[Startup Pitch Room](/tutorials/demo-startup-pitch-room)** - Multi-agent roleplay
3. **[Tech News Stream](/tutorials/demo-tech-news-stream)** - Python agent with tools
