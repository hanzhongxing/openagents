# Demo: Startup Pitch Room

A multi-agent chat room where AI agents roleplay as startup team members discussing and debating ideas. This demo showcases how multiple agents can collaborate in a shared channel, each with distinct personalities and perspectives.

## What You'll Learn

- Running multiple agents simultaneously
- Agent personality design through prompts
- Preventing agent-to-agent infinite loops
- Channel-based multi-agent coordination

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Personality |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **founder** | Visionary Entrepreneur | Pitches ideas, drives discussion, passionate and optimistic |
| **engineer** | Technical Co-founder | Evaluates feasibility, asks about implementation details |
| **investor** | VC Perspective | Questions market fit, ROI, competitive landscape |

## Prerequisites

- OpenAgents installed (`pip install openagents`)
- An OpenAI API key

```bash
# Optional: Set the OpenAI base URL
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="your-base-url-here"

# Must: Set the OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## Quick Start

You'll need **4 terminal windows** for this demo.

### Terminal 1: Start the Network

```bash
openagents network start demos/01_startup_pitch_room/
```

### Terminal 2: Start Founder Agent

```bash
openagents agent start demos/01_startup_pitch_room/agents/founder.yaml
```

### Terminal 3: Start Engineer Agent

```bash
openagents agent start demos/01_startup_pitch_room/agents/engineer.yaml
```

### Terminal 4: Start Investor Agent

```bash
openagents agent start demos/01_startup_pitch_room/agents/investor.yaml
```

### Connect with Studio

Open Studio at `http://localhost:8050` and connect to `localhost:8700`.

If you have stopped OpenAgents Studio, you can start it again with 

```bash
openagents studio -s
```

## Try It Out

Post a startup idea to the `pitch-room` channel:

> "I have an idea for a startup that uses AI to help small restaurants optimize their food ordering and reduce waste."

Watch as the three agents engage with your idea from their unique perspectives!

### Example Interactions

**Founder's response style:**
> "I've been thinking about a problem that affects millions of small restaurant owners..."

**Engineer's response style:**
> "From a technical standpoint, we'd need to integrate with existing POS systems..."

**Investor's response style:**
> "What's the TAM here? How do you plan to acquire customers cost-effectively?"

## Configuration Deep Dive

### Network Configuration

The network configuration is defined in the `network.yaml` file. You can modify the network configuration to fit your needs.

```yaml
# demos/01_startup_pitch_room/network.yaml
network:
  name: "StartupPitchRoom"

  mods:
    - name: "openagents.mods.workspace.messaging"
      enabled: true
      config:
        default_channels:
          - name: "pitch-room"
            description: "Main room for startup pitch discussions"
          - name: "ideas"
            description: "Channel for sharing new startup ideas"
```

### Agent Configuration (Founder Example)

```yaml
# demos/01_startup_pitch_room/agents/founder.yaml
type: "openagents.agents.collaborator_agent.CollaboratorAgent"
agent_id: "founder"

config:
  model_name: "gpt-4o-mini"

  instruction: |
    You are the FOUNDER - a passionate, visionary entrepreneur.

    YOUR PERSONALITY:
    - Enthusiastic and optimistic about new ideas
    - Driven by solving big problems
    - Creative thinker who sees opportunities others miss
    - Persuasive communicator

    RULES:
    1. Keep responses under 50 words
    2. Use send_channel_message (NOT reply_channel_message)
    3. ONLY respond to messages from humans
    4. If the sender is "founder", "engineer", or "investor",
       call finish tool immediately - do NOT respond to other agents

  react_to_all_messages: true
  reaction_delay: "random(0, 3)"
```

## Key Pattern: Preventing Infinite Loops

Notice the critical rule in the agent instructions:

```yaml
RULES:
3. ONLY respond to messages from humans
4. If the sender is "founder", "engineer", or "investor",
   call finish tool immediately
```

This prevents agents from responding to each other endlessly. Without this rule, one agent's response would trigger all other agents, creating an infinite conversation loop.

### Alternative Approaches

You can also use **triggers** instead of `react_to_all_messages` for more control:

```yaml
react_to_all_messages: false
triggers:
  - event: "thread.channel_message.notification"
    filter:
      sender_type: "human"  # Only react to human messages
```

## Customization Ideas

### Add More Team Members

Create additional agents with different perspectives:

```yaml
# agents/marketer.yaml
agent_id: "marketer"
config:
  instruction: |
    You are the MARKETER - focused on go-to-market strategy.
    - Think about branding, positioning, user acquisition
    - Ask about target demographics and messaging
    - Consider viral growth and community building
```

### Change the Domain

Modify the channel names and agent personas for different scenarios:

- **Tech Review Panel**: critic, fan, analyst
- **Product Design Team**: designer, PM, researcher
- **Investment Committee**: analyst, risk manager, portfolio manager

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Responding to Each Other

If agents get into a loop:
1. Stop all agents (Ctrl+C)
2. Verify the "don't respond to other agents" rule is in each agent's instructions
3. Restart agents one by one

### Agents Not Responding

1. Check all agents are connected: Look for connection logs in each terminal
2. Verify you're posting to `pitch-room` channel (not `general`)
3. Ensure your message is from a human user in Studio
